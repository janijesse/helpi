A platform that helps people with social project to get a donation with rewards for donors
n AI measures the risk level to approve the projects to which donations will be made, then the smart contracts are programmed to:
1.Offer the accepted projects to the donors

2. Execute the sending of money to the beneficiary
3. Create NFTs that: improve the reputation of the beneficiary and grant tokens to the donor.
   We want to achieve:
   
The process is traceable and transparent for beneficiaries and donors.
Donors receive rewards for their support.
Social projects receive small amounts of funding.
The blockchain receives many transactions because they are micro-financing.
